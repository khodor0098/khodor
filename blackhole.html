   <h1>Did you know?</h1>
   <p>The center of our Milky Way galaxy contains
   a giant black hole  with the mass equivalent
   to about 4 million Suns or about 3x1036kg.</p>
   </div>
  <dt> <h2> what is black hole ?</h2></dt>
  <dd>A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that  even</br>
  light can not get out.the  gravity is so strong  because  matter has  been</br>
  squeezed into  a tiny space.  This  can  happen  when a star is dying.</br>
Because  no  light  can  get  out,  people  can't  see black holes.They are </br>
 invisible. Space  telescopes  with special tools can help find black  holes.</br>
 The special tools can see how stars that  are  very close  to  black  holes</br>
 act differently than other stars.  </dd>


 <dt><h2>How Big Are Black Holes?</h2></dt>

 <dd> Black holes can be  big or small. Scientists think the smallest black </br>
 holes are as small as  just one  atom. These black holes are very tiny but</br>
 have the mass of a large mountain. Mass is the amount of matter, or "stuff,"</br>
 in an object. Another kind of  black hole is called "stellar." Its mass can</br>
 be up to 20  times more than the  mass of the sun. There may  be many, many </br>
 stellar mass black holes in Earth's galaxy.  Earth's  galaxy is  called the</br>
 Milky Way. The largest black holes  are called  "supermassive." These black</br>
 holes have masses that are  more  than 1 million  suns together. Scientists </br>
 have found proof that every large galaxy contains a supermassive black hole</br>
 at its center.The supermassive  black hole  at the  center of the Milky Way </br>
 galaxy is called Sagittarius A. It has a mass equal to about 4 million suns</br>
 and would fit inside a very large ball that could hold a few million Earths. </br> </dd>
<dt><h2>How Do Black Holes Form?</h2></dt>
  <div class="picture2">
   <img src="../images2/black5.jpg" alt="Not found" >

   <p>An artist's drawing a black hole named Cygnus X-1. It formed when a large star caved in.
   This black hole pulls matter from blue star beside it.</p>
   </div>
 <dd> Scientists think the smallest black holes formed when the universe began.</br>
 Stellar black holes are made when the center of a very big star falls in upon itself, </br>
 or collapses.When this happens, it causes a supernova. A supernova is an exploding  </br>
 star that blastspart of the star into space. Scientists think supermassive black  </br>
 holes were made at the same time as the galaxy they are in. </br>
</dd>
  <dt><h2>Could a Black Hole Destroy Earth?</h2></dt>
  <dd>Black holes do not go around in space eating stars, moons and planets. Earth</br>
  will not fall into a black hole because no black hole is close enough to the solar</br>
  system for Earth to do that . Even if a black hole the same mass as the sun were </br>
  to take the place of the sun, Earth still would not fall in. The black hole would</br>
  have the same gravity as the sun.Earth and the other planets would orbit the black</br>
  hole as they orbit the sun now. The sun will never turn into a black hole. The sun</br>
  is not a big enough star to make a black hole.</br></dd>

   <h1 data-text="whitehole">whitehole</h1>
   <div class="whatis">
   <dt><h2>what is white hole ?</h2></dt>
   <dd>white hole is a hypothetical region of spacetime and singularity which cannot be entered from the outside,</br>
   although energy-matter, light and information can escape from it. In this sense, it is the reverse of a black hole,</br>
   which can be entered only from the outside and from which energy-matter, light and information cannot escape.</br>
   White holes appear in the theory of eternal black holes. In addition to a black hole region in the future,</br>
   such a solution of the Einstein field equations has a white hole region in its past.</br>
   However, this region does not exist for black holes that have formed through gravitational collapse,</br>
   nor are there any observed physical processes through which a white hole could be formed.</dd>
           <video class="whitevideo" src="../images2/white1.mp4" controls poster="../images2/white3.jfif" ></video>

   <dt><h2>Why white holes don't exist</h2></dt>
   <dd>While general relativity describes white holes in theory, no one knows how one might actually form.,</br>
   A black hole cordons off its bit of space when a star collapses into a tiny volume, but playing this,</br>
   video backwards doesn't make physical sense. An event horizon exploding into a functional star would,</br>
   look a bit like an egg unscrambling itself — a violation of the statistical law demanding that the,</br>
   universe gets messier over time.,</br>
   Even if large white holes did form, they probably wouldn't hang around too long. Any outgoing matter,</br>
   would collide with the matter in orbit, and the system would collapse into a black hole. "A long-lived,</br>
   white hole, I think, is very unlikely," said Hal Haggard, a theoretical physicist at Bard College in,</br>
   New York.
